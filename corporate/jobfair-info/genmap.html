<p><font face="Helvetica">How to get to the Union:<br></p>

<p><em>From Interstate 74:</em><br></p>
<p>Exit Interstate 74 at Lincoln Ave.  Proceed south on Lincoln Ave. to Springfield Ave.  Turn right (East) on Springfield.  Proceed to 6th St.  Turn left (South) on 6th.  Go south to the next light which will be Green.  Turn left (West) on Green.  You will enter campus.  The Union will be on your right.<br></p>

<p>Do not attempt to turn directly from Lincoln onto Green, since it is likely that you will be unable to enter the Union from the West due to constructions</p>

<p><em>From I-57 or I-72:</em></p>

<p>Take I-57 to I-74, follow I-74 directions</p>

<p><em>From Willard Airport:</em></p>

<p>After leaving the airport take US-45 (Neil or Dunlap Streets depending on location) north (this should be a left turn).  You will proceed north on Neil for quite a while, until you reach Green St.  Turn right (East) on Green.  Green will eventually enter campus after several blocks.  The Union will be on your right.</p>

<p>The City of Champaign parking lot which we recommend for parking is marked on the map.  The total cost for a day's parking will be about $8-$10.  Other parking locations may also be available, but this is the recommended location.</p>
